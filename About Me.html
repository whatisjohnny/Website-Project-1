        <p>
          One of the things I enjoy most is snowboarding. I've been snowboarding
          for around 6 years and it's still one of my favourite things.
          Unfortunately, I can only do it in the winter, and in the past few
          best to go a few times this year though.

          Another thing I spend a lot of time on is FPS games. I play a select
          few, like
          <a
            href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege"
            target="blank_"
            >R6</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="blank_">Valorant</a>,
          as those are the only ones I'm confident enough in my skill to be able
          to play. Other games like
          <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" target="blank_">Apex</a>
          or
          <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/" target="blank_">Overwatch</a>
          don't feel as appealing to me. I'm always open to try new things,
          however it can be hard for me to do something im not good at
          consistently.

        <h2>Sports</h2>

        <p>
          I've been playing football since the 3rd grade, although I don't enjoy
          it too much, I still enjoy working as a team with others to accomplish
          goals. Im not super great at it, and I don't play it too often, but it's
          been a part of my life for so long it means enough to me.

        <h2>Music</h2>

        <p>
          My music taste is very odd. It varies from things more indie and
          underground to very soft and slow music. Some artists I like in
          particular are,
