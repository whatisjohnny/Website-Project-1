      <h1>Autobiography - Johnny Hendrey</h1>

      <hr />
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        My name is Johnny. This webpage is about all of the things I enjoy doing
        and some things about me!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll be talking about some of the things I like and going into detail
        about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I dont have that many things that im fully invested in. I do
        a lot of stuff, but i'm not good at anything in specific.

      <p>
        I've always been a very introverted person. I've been getting more
        social recently, but it's always been tough for me to find ways to start
        conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not super athletic, I go to the gym, but I haven't been going long
        enough for any results to show. I'm hoping they will soon!

        I live in the West End so I spend a lot of my time at the mall. I enjoy
        going for walks around my neighborhood late at night and hanging out
        with my friends. I don't know that many people from the west end so it
        can be tough meeting up sometimes. I used to live here in the south
        side, but I moved earlier this year. My neighborhood is nice, but I miss
        my friends.

        I moved to edmonton at the start of grade 8 from stony plain, a small
        town just outside of the city, and I haven't seen anyone I used to know
        since. since. It sucks, but i'm glad i've had the opportunity to meet
        new people and have more friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a few clubs I want to join here at Ainlay. One being the chess
        club. I used to play competitively online so I know a bit about the
        game. Although the odds are slim, I'm also looking to join the student
        council this year. It's something new to me and I'd love to be a part of
        it! I enjoy helping people and working together so it sounded appealing
        to me when I first heard of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm looking into a career path involved in computer science and
        programming. I would also like to study the medical field if i get the
        opportunity, however I feel like I would enjoy a job that has to do with
        technology a lot more. I saw this option and thought it was perfect so
        im glad im taking it!
