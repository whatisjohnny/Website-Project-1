      <hr />
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Johnny. This webpage is about all of the things I enjoy doing
        and some things about me!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll be talking about some of the things I like and going into detail
        about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I dont have that many things that im fully invested in. I do
        a lot of stuff, but i'm not good at anything in specific.

      <h1>Myself</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I've always been a very introverted person. I've been geeting more
        social recently, but it's always been tough for me to find ways to start
        conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not super athletic, I go to the gym, but I haven't been going long
        enough for any results to show. I'm hoping they will soon!
      </p>

      <p>
        I live in the West End so I spend a lot of my time at the mall. I enjoy
        going for walks around my neighborhood late at night and hanging out
        with my friends. I don't know that many people from the west end so it
        can be tough meeting up sometimes. I used to live here in the south
        side, but I moved earlier this year. My neighborhood is nice, but I miss
        my friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        I moved to edmonton at the start of grade 8 from stony plain, a small
        town just outside of the city, and I haven't seen anyone I used to know
        since. since. It sucks, but i'm glad i've had the opportunity to meet
        new people and have more friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a few clubs I want to join here at Ainlay. One being the chess
        club. I used to play competitively online so I know a bit about the
        game. Although the odds are slim, I'm also looking to join the student
        council this year. It's something new to me and I'd love to be a part of
        it! I enjoy helping people and working together so it sounded appealing
        to me when I first heard of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm looking into a career path involved in computer science and
        programming. I would also like to study the medical field if i get the
        opportunity, however I feel like I would enjoy a job that has to do with
        technology a lot more. I saw this option and thought it was perfect so
        im glad im taking it!

      <h2>Snowboarding</h2>
      <p>
        One of the things I enjoy most is snowboarding. I've been snowboarding
        for around 6 years and it's still one of my favourite things.
        Unfortunately, I can only do it in the winter, and in the past few
        years, I haven't gotten the chance to go. I'm definitely going to try my
        best to go a few times this year though.
      </p>

      <h2>Games</h2>
      <p>
        Another thing I spend a lot of time on is FPS games. I play a select
        few, like
        <a
          href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege"
          target="blank_"
          >R6</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="blank_">Valorant</a>,
        as those are the only ones I'm confident enough in my skill to be able
        to play. Other games like
        <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" target="blank_">Apex</a>
        or
        <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/" target="blank_">Overwatch</a>
        don't feel as appealing to me. I'm always open to try new things,
        however it can be hard for me to do something im not good at
        consistently.
      </p>

      <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>
        I've been playing football since the 3rd grade, although I don't enjoy
        it too much, I still enjoy working as a team with others to accomplish
        goals. Im not super great at it, and I don't play it too often, but it's
        been a part of my life for so long it means enough to me.
      </p>
      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        My music taste is very odd. It varies from things more indie and
        underground to very soft and slow music. Some artists I like in
        particular are,

        <li>Yeat</li>

        <li>Mitski</li>

        <li>TV Girl</li>

        <li>Deftones</li>

        <li>Summrs</li>

        <li>Lil Double O</li>

        <li>Future</li>

        <li>Lana Del Rey</li>
